# piv-agent

## About

This is an implementation of a simple PIV client for desktop Linux and OSX with
minimal dependencies. It contains a `piv-tool` binary which can conduct basic
operations using PIV cards, and the `piv-agent`, which implements the SSH agent
protocol as a drop-in replacement for the OpenSSH `ssh-agent` command (except
that the keys it contains are always on a PIV card).

"PIV cards" notably includes Yubico Yubikey devices such as the NEO and
Yubikey4, which can store up to 24 keys by using the "retired key" slots (which
this agent supports).

This project re-uses most of the agent and protocol parsing code from OpenSSH,
where it's been pretty thoroughly battle-hardened.

## Using the agent

Using the PIV agent is identical to running the normal `ssh-agent` command,
with the exception that `piv-agent` requires a `-g` argument specifying the
GUID of the PIV card to attach to. You can also give a `-K` argument with
the public key of the "Card Authentication" slot (9E) for extra security.

For example, the GUID of my PIV card is `995E171383029CDA0D9CDBDBAD580813` (if
you don't know your GUID, the `piv-tool` command can display it). I can use the
following command to start the `piv-agent` against my card:

-----
$ piv-agent -g 995E171383029CDA0D9CDBDBAD580813 bash
$ ssh-add -l
256 SHA256:PJ6ucGKUqlQhiJdArDaF65+AVImg8SVq77vL6nVE/ME PIV_slot_9C /CN=Digital Signature (ECDSA)
256 SHA256:U86TVxP/gxVk4CQibIWit3Q+/5i4aZuXa2NALIahjww PIV_slot_9E /CN=Card Authentication (ECDSA)
-----

I can now use the 9E Card Authentication key with `ssh` or any other tools that
use speak the OpenSSH agent protocol (e.g. the Joyent `manta` and `triton`
tools). If I try to use the 9C Digital Signature key right now though, I will
get an error like this:

-----
$ ssh user@host
sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation
user@host: Permission denied (publickey).
-----

To use the 9C key I will have to give my PIV PIN to the agent using the
`ssh-add -X` command, so that it can unlock the card to use the key.

-----
$ ssh-add -X
Enter lock password:
Agent unlocked.
$ ssh user@host
Last login: Wed Mar 28 21:56:11 2018 from laptop
[user@host ~]$
-----

The PIV PIN is stored in memory only with special guard pages allocated either
side of it and marked non-swappable. On Linux the memory area is also marked as
non-dumpable so that it does not appear in core files.

You can make the agent forget the PIN by using the `ssh-add -x` command to
"lock" it. You can supply any password you like (including an empty string)
for the "lock" command. The command `ssh-add -D` can also be used, and will not
prompt for a password (useful from scripts).

The agent will also forget the PIN automatically if the PIV card is unavailable
for more than a few minutes, or if unusual conditions occur (e.g. an attacker
tries to plug in a device with the same GUID that fails the 9E signature test).

Note that it's perfectly fine to leave the `piv-agent` running and remove your
PIV card: the agent will just return errors on any attempt to use it until
you insert your card again (you will need to enter your PIN again). You can
even start the agent without the PIV card present at all.

One useful way to use the `piv-agent` is to set up a systemd unit file for it
to run whenever you log in, and adjust your shell profile to use it as your
normal SSH agent. Then your PIV keys are automatically ready for use in any
shell.

## Other tools

There are two other tools that can be built as part of this repository as well:
`piv-tool` and `piv-zfs`. The `piv-tool` utility is a general-purpose PIV
information and management tool that uses the same client code as `piv-agent`,
which can be useful for testing or debugging (you don't have to use it for
setting up keys, you can use `yubico-piv-tool` or any other PIV client just as
well).

The `piv-zfs` tool is an early draft of a tool for managing ZFS
encryption-at-rest keys using PIV EC. You can see a brief demo of it in action
at https://asciinema.org/a/dsENdri85rPkOk6jpWsqCkUzn. The Makefile will only
try to build `piv-zfs` on Linux or illumos and only if it detects `libzfs` is
available.

## Installing on Linux

On Linux you will need to have a compiler and basic build tools and headers
installed, as well as the libraries `pcsclite` and `libbsd` (and their `-dev`
packages if your distro does those). Some `musl` based distros will also require
installing `libedit`.

Then, clone this repository and use `make` to build the binaries:

-----
$ git clone https://github.com/arekinath/piv-agent
$ cd piv-agent
$ make
$ ./piv-tool list
      card: 995E1713
    device: Yubico Yubikey NEO OTP+U2F+CCID 02 00
     chuid: ok
      guid: 995E171383029CDA0D9CDBDBAD580813
     owner: 00000000000000000000000000000000
    fasc-n: D4E739DA739CED39CE739D836858210842108421384210C3F5
    expiry: 2030-01-01
    yubico: implements YubicoPIV extensions (v1.0.4)
      auth: PIN*
     slots:
           ID   TYPE    BITS  CERTIFICATE
           9c   ECDSA   256   /CN=Digital Signature
           9e   ECDSA   256   /CN=Card Authentication

-----

You can run `make install` (as root or with sudo) to install the agent into
`/opt/piv-agent`.  The `make setup` invocation can be used to set up a user
systemd service to start it automatically at login.  It will also print out
lines to add to your `.profile` or `.bashrc` to make sure the agent is
automatically available in all your shells (while still preferring a forwarded
SSH agent if you SSH into your machine later).

-----
$ make setup
Enter a GUID to use for piv-agent: 995E171383029CDA0D9CDBDBAD580813

install -d /home/alex/.config/piv-agent
install .dist/default_config /home/alex/.config/piv-agent/default
systemctl --user enable piv-agent@default.service
systemctl --user start piv-agent@default.service

Add the following lines to your .profile or .bashrc:
  export PATH=/opt/piv-agent/bin:$PATH
  if [[ ! -e "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" || "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" == *"/keyring/"* ]]; then
    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/ssh-agent.socket"
  fi

## Installing on OSX

Compiling on OSX is even easier. Rather than depend on homebrew or MacPorts or
another similar system, we simply build `libressl-portable` in a subdirectory
and statically link the binaries against it. The Makefile in this repository
will handle it all for you.

Note there is no need to install PCSClite or OpenSC or any of the related
tools or libraries on OSX -- the PCSC framework built into the operating system
itself works fine for `piv-agent`.

The commands you will need to run are as follows:

-----
## Clone the piv-agent repository
$ git clone https://github.com/arekinath/piv-agent
$ cd piv-agent

## Build libressl and then piv-agent
$ make -j4
$ ./piv-tool list
      card: 995E1713
    device: Yubico Yubikey NEO OTP+U2F+CCID 02 00
     chuid: ok
      guid: 995E171383029CDA0D9CDBDBAD580813
     owner: 00000000000000000000000000000000
    fasc-n: D4E739DA739CED39CE739D836858210842108421384210C3F5
    expiry: 2030-01-01
    yubico: implements YubicoPIV extensions (v1.0.4)
      auth: PIN*
     slots:
           ID   TYPE    BITS  CERTIFICATE
           9c   ECDSA   256   /CN=Digital Signature
           9e   ECDSA   256   /CN=Card Authentication

## Install in /opt/piv-agent
$ sudo make install
install -o root -g wheel -m 0755 -d /opt/piv-agent/bin
install -o root -g wheel -m 0755 piv-agent /opt/piv-agent/bin
install -o root -g wheel -m 0755 piv-tool /opt/piv-agent/bin
## Configure and add a launchd service for the agent
$ make setup
Enter a GUID to use for piv-agent: 995E171383029CDA0D9CDBDBAD580813

install .dist/net.cooperi.piv-agent.plist /Users/alex/Library/LaunchAgents
launchctl load /Users/alex/Library/LaunchAgents/net.cooperi.piv-agent.plist
launchctl start net.cooperi.piv-agent

Add the following lines to your .profile or .bashrc:
  export PATH=/opt/piv-agent/bin:$PATH
  if [[ ! -e "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" || "$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" == *"launchd"* ]]; then
    source $HOME/.ssh/agent.env >/dev/null
  fi

-----

There is one known issue on OSX currently: the PCSC framework does not work
after calling `fork()`, which forces the `piv-agent` code to not be able to run
in the background (this means using `piv-agent bash` to start a shell doesn't
work, for example). The best way to use it on OSX is set up as a launchd
service.

Like on Linux, there is a `make install` target that will set up a `launchd`
service for the `piv-agent` for you and advise you on what to add to `.profile`
to make it available in all new shells.
